genpass
=======

This script will generate a random password by picking words from the
provided word list. The pool of words comes from Oren Tirosh's
[mnemonic encoding](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918202746/http://tothink.com/mnemonic/wordlist.html)
project.

Usage
-----

Just run the script and provide the number of words you'd like your
password to be composed of:

    $ ./genpass 4
    undersnakeoctopusmentor
